### RET.TECH

RET.TECH is an Augmented Reality (AR) try-on experience in which users are able to trace the correlation between the design styles of retro-futuristic sci-fi films and modern fashions from brands seeking to embody futurism. Behind every design style is a catalyst event throughout history, and within retro sci-fi films, we have used design to convey our hopes and fears for the future. This project seeks to convey that in emmulating the design syles of retro-futurism, such as cyberpunk, art deco, and more, we are also seeking to convey the same desires and fears for our future. RET.TECH brings light to the fact that those feelings have not left us, even as technology accelerates.
